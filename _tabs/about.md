I am a security researcher. I hold a master's degree in computer science. My thesis is entitled "lightweight anonymous privacy-preserving three-factor authentication scheme for WSN-based IIoT." I was honored to be advised by [Majid Bayat](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DYtGajIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mohammadali Doostari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ncsPed4AAAAJ). My research interests lie in Security, Applied cryptography, Internet of Things, Blockchain, AI Security and Privacy, and Network Security and Privacy.

In June 2020, as a talented graduate student, I have been selected as lecturer and researcher by the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology (MSRT) to complete the Iranian conscription. Iranian conscription is mandatory for all men in Iran, and it takes two years to complete.
